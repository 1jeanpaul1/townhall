# townhall

townhall seeks to improve the process by which new businesses are started, both for the owners of new businesses and the people they are seeking to serve. Uesrs in the community have an opportunity to suggest commercial ventures that they feel would best serve their unique needs and wants in the form of “idea” posts, as well as discuss and rate the suggestions of others in their community. People seeking to start new businesses can use this forum to evaluate the desires of their target community and adjust their ideas accordingly, and then bring their ideas to the community in the form of “venture” posts. Users can also interact with “ventures”, allowing entrepreneurs to judge the community response to their product before taking the risk of making a business out of it.

The project was made in the Django framework for Python. We created a database using PSQL that held our user and post information. The front-end was designed in the Bootstrap framework for HTML.
